# Wumpus-World-AI

This was a group project done by Sneha Ravisankar, Agarwal Gopal and Chai Youxiang

Wumpus World is a finite grid world (3x3 Square in this Assignment), which is populated by an Agent, a Wumpus, Confundus Portals and Coins. In this world the Agent is mobile and all other items remain fixed through the game. There can only be one item per cell. Our goal while working on this project was to create an Agent using prolog which will be able to navigate the Wumpus World successfully. In order to do this the agent must have to take deterministic actions which prevents it from being caught by the Wumpus, while collecting all the coins on the map. Additionally, we also created a driver that tests our agent.

Agent was made using Prolog 
Driver was created using Python
